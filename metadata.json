You will still get an actionPerformed value returned when passing 0, so this may be used to determine if any action was performed since your last heartbeat, without actually registering a new heartbeat. Passing a negative value will result in an error being returned, INVALID_INPUT_DATA. Any errors while registering your heartbeat will result in a error being returned, UNEXPECTED_ERROR.
